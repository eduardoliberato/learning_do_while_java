# learning_do_while_java
This is an example of how to use the loop "do while" in java 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, 
then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
